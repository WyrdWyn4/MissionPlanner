Mission Planner Lua Script Example
Task: Load flight boundary coordinates, go to a random waypoint, then return to home.

Note: This script is a simplified template.
Replace the placeholder function 'goto_waypoint' with the actual Mission Planner API call
(such as sending a waypoint command via MAVLink or using a built-in function) as appropriate.
